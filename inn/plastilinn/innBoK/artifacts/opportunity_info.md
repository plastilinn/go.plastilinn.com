- ## Description
  In business modeling, the concept of "opportunity" refers to a set of circumstances that makes it possible for a business to achieve specific, strategic goals. Opportunities can arise from a variety of sources, such as changes in market trends, technological advancements, shifts in customer needs or behaviors, or regulatory changes. 
  
  Opportunities are a crucial component of a business model as they provide the basis for the creation of value. They represent potential avenues for growth and profitability, and they guide the strategic decisions that a business makes in terms of its products, services, operations, and market positioning. 
  
  For example, a software company might identify an opportunity in the growing demand for remote work solutions. This opportunity could guide the company's product development efforts, leading to the creation of a new software solution that enables efficient remote collaboration. 
  
  In essence, the concept of "opportunity" in business modeling is about identifying and capitalizing on the potential for growth and value creation. It is a critical element in business design, driving strategic decision-making, innovation, and competitive positioning. It shapes the business's strategies for product development, market entry, customer engagement, and revenue generation.

- ## Tools
  - [[Business Model Canvas]]
    - In the Business Model Canvas, the "opportunity" component can be related to the "value proposition" block. This block describes the unique value that a company offers to its customers. It's where the company identifies opportunities to create and deliver new value to its customers. 
  - [[SWOT Analysis]]
    - The "opportunities" component of the SWOT analysis directly relates to the concept of business opportunities. This analysis helps businesses identify new opportunities for revenue generation or value creation within their business model, as well as potential threats that could hinder these opportunities.
  - [[Blue Ocean Strategy]]
    - This strategy involves creating a new, uncontested market space (or "blue ocean") that makes competitors irrelevant. It's about identifying and seizing new opportunities that are not currently being exploited by any other company. 
  - [[Porter's Five Forces]]
    - This tool helps businesses understand the competitive forces in their industry and identify potential opportunities. For example, a company might identify an opportunity in an industry where the power of suppliers is low, the threat of new entrants is low, and there is little threat of substitute products.
  - [[Ansoff Matrix]]
    - This strategic planning tool helps businesses decide their product and market growth strategy. It can help identify opportunities for growth either by marketing existing products in new ways or markets (market development, product development) or creating new products for new markets (diversification).
  - [[Value Chain Analysis]]
    - This tool looks at the activities that go into creating a product or service with the aim of identifying those that could be improved or optimized. This can help a business identify opportunities to create more value for customers or reduce costs.
  - [[PESTEL Analysis]]
    - By analyzing Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Ecological, and Legal factors, companies can identify how these external factors create opportunities for new revenue streams or value creation. For example, technological advancements can offer new opportunities for product or service innovation.
