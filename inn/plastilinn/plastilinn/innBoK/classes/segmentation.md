- ### Definition 
  - segmentation refers to the process of dividing a market or customer base into distinct groups or segments based on certain characteristics or criteria. These characteristics can include demographic factors such as age, gender, income, or location, as well as psychographic factors such as interests, values, or lifestyle.

Segmentation is important in business because it allows companies to better understand and target specific groups of customers who share similar needs, preferences, or behaviors. By tailoring products, services, and marketing efforts to these segments, businesses can improve customer satisfaction, increase sales, and gain a competitive advantage in the market.
